# ðŸ§¾ How It Works
1) Input Opening Balances
Enter the available denominations and amounts for each currency at the start of the day or period.

2) Record Transactions
Log each buy and sell transaction with denomination details and date.

3) Auto-Update Inventory
The sheet will automatically calculate the updated cash and denomination balances after every entry.

4) Analyze With Dashboards
Use the summary pages to monitor inventory and transaction history at a glance.

# ðŸ“Š Example Use Case
Say you begin the day with:

    USD: $1000 (in $100, $50, $20 notes)

    EUR: â‚¬800 (in â‚¬100, â‚¬50 notes)

You then:

    Buy $500 in $50 notes

    Sell â‚¬200 in â‚¬100 notes

The sheet will automatically:

- Update total purchase/sale counts

- Adjust denomination-level inventory

- Show updated closing balance in both dashboards
