# ðŸ“Š Example Use Case
Say you begin the day with:

    USD: $1000 (in $100, $50, $20 notes)

    EUR: â‚¬800 (in â‚¬100, â‚¬50 notes)

You then:

    Buy $500 in $50 notes

    Sell â‚¬200 in â‚¬100 notes

The sheet will automatically:

- Update total purchase/sale counts

- Adjust denomination-level inventory

- Show updated closing balance in both dashboards
